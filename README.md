Note:
Due to some issues with my personal GitHub account, I have used my friend’s account to upload and share the Employee Salary Prediction Jupyter notebook.I kindly request that this be taken into consideration during the evaluation of my project.

🧾 How to Use the Google Colab Notebook (Step-by-Step):

Open the Notebook in Google Colab

--Click on the notebook file link (from GitHub or Google Drive).

--Choose “Open in Colab” to launch the notebook in your browser.


Upload or Load the Dataset:

 upload it using: left side option -> choose the table to content -> files -> upload option -> select the csv file Adult_Dataset.csv 
   After uploading copy path and put  [.read_csv() ] with the appropriate link.


Run Each Code Cell Sequentially

Click on a code cell and press Shift + Enter to run it.

Proceed from data preprocessing to visualization, model training, and evaluation step-by-step.


Review Outputs and Visualizations

Check each cell’s output to ensure data was loaded and models are working correctly.
