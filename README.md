Note:
Due to some issues with my personal GitHub account, I have used my friend’s account to upload and share the Employee Salary Prediction Jupyter notebook.I kindly request that this be taken into consideration during the evaluation of my project.

# How to Use the Google Colab Notebook (Step-by-Step):
  [01] Open the Notebook in Google Colab
  [02] Click on the notebook file link (from GitHub or Google Drive).
  [03] Choose “Open in Colab” to launch the notebook in your browser.
  [04] Upload or Load the Dataset:
       upload it using: left side option -> choose the table to content -> files -> upload option -> select the csv file Adult_Dataset.csv 
  [05] After uploading copy path and put  [.read_csv() ] with the appropriate link.
  [06] Run Each Code Cell Sequentially
  [07] Click on a code cell and press Shift + Enter to run it.
  [08] Proceed from data preprocessing to visualization, model training, and evaluation step-by-step.
  [09] Review Outputs and Visualizations
  [10] Check each cell’s output to ensure data was loaded and models are working correctly.

# Technologies Used
- Python – Core programming language used for all stages of the project.
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development environment for writing and testing code.
- CSV File Format – Used for storing and loading the dataset.

# Libraries and Tools Used

  pandas – For reading, manipulating, and analyzing structured data.
  numpy – For numerical operations and array handling.

# Data Visualization
- matplotlib.pyplot – For plotting basic charts like bar plots and histograms.
- seaborn – For advanced visualization including heatmaps and boxplots.

# Data Preprocessing
- LabelEncoder – To convert categorical data into numeric format.
- StandardScaler – To normalize feature scales before training.
- train_test_split – For splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

# Machine Learning Models
- LogisticRegression – Linear model for binary classification.
- RandomForestClassifier – Ensemble model using decision trees.
- GradientBoostingClassifier – Boosted trees for classification.
- SVC – Support Vector Machine for classification tasks.
- KNeighborsClassifier – KNN for instance-based learning.
- XGBClassifier – XGBoost model for efficient gradient boosting.
