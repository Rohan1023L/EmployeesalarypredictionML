Note:
Due to some issues with my personal GitHub account, I have used my friend’s account to upload and share the Employee Salary Prediction Jupyter notebook.I kindly request that this be taken into consideration during the evaluation of my project.

# How to Use the Google Colab Notebook (Step-by-Step):
  1. Open the Notebook in Google Colab
  2. Click on the notebook file link (from GitHub or Google Drive).
  3. Choose “Open in Colab” to launch the notebook in your browser.
  4. Upload or Load the Dataset: upload it using: left side option -> choose the table to content -> files -> upload option -> select the csv file Adult_Dataset.csv
  5. After uploading copy path and put  [.read_csv() ] with the appropriate link.
  6. Run Each Code Cell Sequentially
  7. Click on a code cell and press Shift + Enter to run it.
  8. Proceed from data preprocessing to visualization, model training, and evaluation step-by-step.
  9. Review Outputs and Visualizations
  10. Check each cell’s output to ensure data was loaded and models are working correctly.

# Technologies Used
- Python – Core programming language used for all stages of the project.
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development environment for writing and testing code.
- CSV File Format – Used for storing and loading the dataset.

# Libraries and Tools Used
- Data Handling and Processing: 
  pandas – For reading, manipulating, and analyzing structured data.
  numpy – For numerical operations and array handling.

# Data Visualization
- matplotlib.pyplot – For plotting basic charts like bar plots and histograms.
- seaborn – For advanced visualization including heatmaps and boxplots.

# Data Preprocessing
- LabelEncoder – To convert categorical data into numeric format.
- StandardScaler – To normalize feature scales before training.
- train_test_split – For splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

# Machine Learning Models
- LogisticRegression – Linear model for binary classification.
- RandomForestClassifier – Ensemble model using decision trees.
- GradientBoostingClassifier – Boosted trees for classification.
- SVC – Support Vector Machine for classification tasks.
- KNeighborsClassifier – KNN for instance-based learning.
- XGBClassifier – XGBoost model for efficient gradient boosting.
